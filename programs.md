	We're always on the lookout for great talent and minds. To do this, we know to attract the best we have to offer the best. That's why over the course of the past year, we have painstakingly worked to formulate and develop various induction avenues into BuildLab to accomodate for diverse skillsets and needs of potential team members like yourself.
</p>

<h2><ins>Educators Program</ins></h2>
<p align="justify">
	BuildLab came about from the simple idea that if you tool young innovative students with hard and soft foundational skills in an environment that celebrates personal and professional growth, a spark of insatiable curiosity would push them beyond their own perceived limitations to do much more than they could have previously envisioned..or at the very least with a sharper conviction.
</p>
<p align="justify">
	Our Educational Trainer/Mentor programme is our way of passing this forward. Driven to serve as an avenue to grow and develop great Waza mentors and trainers, we push to instill a sense of empowerment through inclusive activities and educational workshops and events that we organise and facilitate at the iHub. Our mentors/trainers are primarily University students from different disciplines who help us in formatting next-generation activity programs/camps like KHC/Waza and in the process better fine-tune their own skills.

<h2><ins>Builders-in-Residence Program</ins></h2>
<p align="justify">
	Panyabot was built by a great team of interns under the guidance and support of the iHub and its amazing team of developers and managers alike. This inspired the development of the Builders-in-Residence Program. Designed and run to support local, young and enterprising hardware innovators, it grew from a notable gap in the development of hands-on hardware entrepreneurship skills in Kenyan tertiary institutions.
